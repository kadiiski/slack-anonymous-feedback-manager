    ðŸ’¡ _Note: you can do this anywhere, in any chat, any time, it will only be seen by you as it's ephemeral messaging. If you have any doubts - do it in your own DMs or with me._
    
    :two: *Retrieve Feedback (Managers Only)*:\n
           - View feedback submitted for one or more people.\n
           - *Format*: \`\get-feedback <password> @recipient1, @recipient2...\`\n
