(_add as many details as possible_)\r\n   - *Format*: `/give-feedback @recipient your feedback`\r\n   - *Example*: `/give-feedback @john_doe Great job on the project etc. etc.!`\r\nðŸ’¡ _Note: you can do this anywhere, in any chat, any time, it will only be seen by you as it's ephemeral messaging. If you have any doubts - do it in your own DMs or with me._\r\n  \r\n*Retrieve Feedback (Managers Only)*:\r\n   - View feedback submitted for one or more people.\r\n   - *Format*: `/get-feedback <password> @recipient1, @recipient2...`\r\n   - *Example*: `/get-feedback secret123 @john_doe, @jane_smith`\r\nðŸ’¡ _Note: you can do this anywhere, in any chat, any time, it will only be seen by you as it's ephemeral messaging. If you have any doubts - do it in your own DMs or with me._\r\n\r\n*Help*:\r\n   - Get this Elmo help message anytime.\r\n   - *Command*: `/help`\r\n  \r\nðŸ’¡ _Note: All messages sent to me are confidential and will be deleted after processing. No names and emails are being saved and feedback is encrypted_\r\n\r\n:elmo: _*Managers* can also initiate a confidential & anonymous discussion about specific feedback item, Elmo will act as a middle man to convey the messages and keep both parties anonymous. When this happens a private thread will be initiated in both people DM chats with Elmo, where they can communicate in the thread._"
